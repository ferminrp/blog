### Highlights

- Social intelligence brings you awareness of the social dynamics in certain social situations. Therefore, you understand who the “dominant” person at the party is; you understand who is shy or reserved. You know who the popular people are, and you know who is not as welcome. You can “read the room,” so they say. You are not lost.
- According to a researcher named Karl Albrecht, the behavior you have in a social situation ranks somewhere on a spectrum between a “nourishing” social effect and a “toxic” social effect. Note that this “toxic” action is something that makes other, surrounding people feel disrespected, guilty, angry, or somehow “less-than.” Note, then, that the “nourishing” social action is something that makes others feel affirmed in their sense of self, happy, intelligent, or otherwise valued in some way. Naturally, you’re aiming for this nourishing social action.
