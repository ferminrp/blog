### Highlights

- It is unsurprising that database interfaces are available for all the major relational databases (MYSQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server); it would be foolish to neglect those established behemoths. However, the advent of Node development has revitalized a new approach to database storage: the so-called NOSQL databases. It's not always helpful to define something as what it's not, so we'll add that these NOSQL databases might be more properly called "document databases" or "key/value pair databases." They provide a conceptually simpler approach to data storage. There are many, but MongoDB is one of the front-runners, and it's the NOSQL database we will be using in this book.
- The primary command you'll be using with npm (unsurprisingly) is install. For example, to install nodemon (a popular utility to automatically restart a Node program when you make changes to the source code), you would issue the following command (on the console):
  npm install -g nodemon 
  The -g flag tells npm to install the package globally, meaning it's available globally on the system. This distinction will become clearer when we cover the package.json files.
  For now, the rule of thumb is that JavaScript utilities (like nodemon) will generally be installed globally, whereas packages that are specific to your web app or project will
