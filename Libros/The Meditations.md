### Highlights

- Busyness is no excuse for neglecting our duties to family, friends, and community.
- He always spoke his opinions outright so we never had to wonder what he really thought.
- Every moment, focus your attention and perform the task at hand with simplicity, efficiency, and dignity. Fill your mind with thoughts of Love, freedom, and justice, leaving no room for negative and destructive thoughts.
- Life is a pilgrimage and a struggle.
- What can guide us? Only one thing: philosophy. Philosophy consists in keeping your inner spirit free, undisturbed, above pain and pleasure; acting with purpose in line with principle; embracing all that happens as coming from the same Source that gave you life; and accepting death as nothing more than a reconfiguration of the elements and particles that make up all things. In other words, living according to nature.
- When your eyes become attuned to Nature and her works, everything is beautiful.
- Don’t waste the rest of your life worrying about what others think and do. Direct your thoughts to a useful end. When you dissipate your mental energy on things you can’t control, you lose the opportunity to accomplish something yourself.
- Put your whole heart and mind into your work, laboring not just for yourself but for the common good. Be a person of few words and a few projects, not busy and scattered.
- Honor the power of discernment, which enables you to form opinions while remaining skeptical of those opinions—subjecting them to further discernment. Don’t stop at first impressions; look deeper, and see whether your opinions are in line with reason and nature.
- People long to escape life’s struggles and relax in country houses, by the seaside, or in the mountains. But it is within your power to find solace at any time, by retreating into yourself. When your thoughts are orderly and tranquil, there’s no place quieter and more peaceful than your own soul. There, you are free.
- Nothing touches the soul; it can’t be harmed by anything external. When you are upset, it is your own opinion that upsets you.
- Always follow these two rules: 1. Act in accordance with reason. Do only what your inner guide tells you is useful and beneficial. 2. Think in accordance with reason. If your opinions cause you distress, change your opinions. Don’t change them to match what’s fashionable or popular, but to align your mind with truth.
- Your life has been a growth of nature. Eventually you’ll disappear back into it, returning to the Source from which you came. Whether sooner or later makes no difference. Live well, in accordance with reason, for as long as you have the chance.
- In all times and places, consider how many people were born, made great efforts, and returned to the earth from which they came. Consider how many others whittled their time away on frivolous pursuits and idle distractions. This exercise will help you keep your own activities in perspective. Focus on what’s important. Give great attention to great matters, and little attention to little matters.
- What, then, should we strive for in life? Right thoughts, beneficial actions, honest speech, and a cheerful disposition. These things are in harmony with, and flow from, the eternal Source of all.
- Look around you and see that everything that happens is the result of change. The universe loves nothing more than to change things, rearranging their elements to create new things. Everything that exists now is a seed of what is to come. Nothing around you is in its final form.
- In evaluating a person, always look for their ruling principles. What do they pursue? What do they avoid? Don’t judge others based on outward circumstances and appearances. Difficult circumstances can befall anyone—what is telling is how a person responds to their circumstances.
- Be the stone cliff against which the waves constantly break, standing firm against the fury of the sea. Am I unhappy because of what happened to me? No. I remain happy because, regardless of circumstances, I am free—neither crushed by the present nor afraid of the future. Storms befall everyone; but not everyone can stand firm against them.
- Rest is for recharging, not for indulgence. Take only what is sufficient for your health and vitality. Too much rest—like too much food or drink—defeats its purpose, weakening the body and dulling the spirit.
- When one sort of person does a good deed, they mark it down as a favor to be repaid. Another sort of person doesn’t seek a reward, but they take satisfaction in knowing that they’ve acted generously. A third sort of person doesn’t even know what they’ve done; they bear good deeds as a vine bears grapes—naturally, without thinking about it. Like a horse after running a race, or a bee after making honey, a good person doesn’t stop and look around for applause or rewards. They go on to produce another good deed, as a vine produces more grapes in season.
- Second, that it is always in my power to think and act in harmony with nature—both my own nature, and the nature of the universe. No one can force me to do otherwise.
- Imagine your ideal future and how you will feel when you’ve “arrived.” It’s in your power to feel that way today—to think the same thoughts and have the same attitude that you would if your surroundings were ideal. Nothing short of death can prevent you from thinking, feeling, and acting as you choose. Choose to live according to your nature as a rational and social being, in harmony with the universe.
- Live such that, when your life is at its end, you may look back and recall how many beautiful things you’ve seen, how many pains you’ve patiently endured, how many pleasures you’ve passed by to stay on your path, and how many disagreeable people you’ve treated kindly.
- Don’t be swayed by how things appear. In the wake of a perceived loss, it’s easy to feel disappointed and discouraged. If your head is hanging low, you’ll miss the opportunities hidden in “misfortune.” But if you remain steady and unbowed, you’ll make your own fortune. For good fortune consists of a good attitude, good thoughts, and good actions.
- The way to peace is to be content with yourself, honor the light of reason within, live in harmony with others, and be grateful to the gods for the universe and your role in it.
- I do my duty, and disregard all else. But if someone shows me where I’m acting wrongly, I will gladly change. For I seek the truth, and the truth never harmed anyone. Continuing in error is what causes injury.
- Exert your efforts within your sphere of power, and be indifferent to everything else. (By “indifferent,” I don’t mean apathetic, but accepting of all that Fate gives you.)
- anything I seek for myself must also be good for Rome and the Earth, or it is not good for me.
- When you need to cheer yourself up, list the good qualities of people you know. Note the generosity of one, the courage of another, the humility of a third, and so on. Nothing delights the mind as much as virtue—especially when we see it embodied in the life of a particular person.
- Listen carefully when others speak. As much as possible, imagine yourself in their shoes and see things from their perspective.
- Why am I angry? It must be I’m entertaining an opinion about something, or an interpretation of an event, that is disturbing my peace.  Things themselves don’t have the power to determine our opinions about them. We form opinions. And negative thinking warps our perceptions as much as jaundice or rabies.
- My thoughts, opinions, and interpretations are all in my power to choose. Why, then, am I continually entertaining worries and fears? I will not allow things outside my mind to affect my mind. I will not let external events shake and shatter my inner peace. I will not waste my energy on things outside my control. I will return to my principles and renew my life.
- Don’t worry about the future. By doing your best today, you’ll build the [[strength]] and resources to handle whatever tomorrow may bring.
- Don’t long for things you don’t have; instead, be grateful for the things you do have. Imagine how desirable they would seem if you didn’t already have them.   At the same time, don’t become so attached to your possessions that you would be upset if they were damaged or lost.
- Stop with your idle daydreaming. Focus on the present. Perform the task at hand. Separate reality from your opinions, or how things appear. Don’t carry grievances—leave them in the past where they belong.
- All that you’ve done before, or failed to do, is of no account. The past is dead and gone. Why carry yesterday’s regrets on your back?  Today is the first day of the rest of your life. Live now according your principles.
- Life is more like a wrestling match than a dance. Plant your feet and brace yourself for every sudden, unexpected challenge.
- Everything is content when it fulfills its nature. A person is content when their thoughts are in harmony with reason (clear, purposeful, truth-seeking, just); when their actions are beneficial for themselves and others; when they limit their desires and dislikes to what is within their sphere of power; and when they accept all that Fate gives them.
- Focus on the task at hand and give it your full attention, whether you are acting, speaking, reading, or thinking by yourself and forming an opinion about something.
- Stop thinking of everything that ever hurt you, and all that might yet hurt you, in your life. Take troubles as they arise—one at a time.
- Equanimity means the calm acceptance of all that exists and all that happens.
- The person who follows reason is simultaneously active and peaceful, cheerful and resolute. Stop wasting energy in fear and procrastination. Your job is to see what needs to be done and then do it. If you see the way forward, proceed without looking back. If you are unsure which way to go, stop and find a trustworthy guide.
- The more things you examine in the light of reason, the stronger your reason grows—just as feeding more wood to a fire makes it burn brighter and higher.
- You’ve been imagining how good you’ll feel someday, if you keep following the path of philosophy. In fact, the blessed state you seek is available right now. Simply let go of the past, trust the future to providence, and live this moment in harmony with nature and reason.
