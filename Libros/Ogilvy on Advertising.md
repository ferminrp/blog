### Highlights

- You aren’t advertising to a standing army; you are advertising to a moving parade. The advertisement which sold a refrigerator to couples who got married last year will probably be just as successful with couples who get married this year.
- ‘Search the parks in all your cities You’ll find no statues of committees.’
- Later, the advertising community turned its back on such research. Agencies which pioneered the search for knowledge now excel in violating the principles their predecessors had discovered.
- Advertising offers four different career paths: 1 You can join a television network, a radio station, a magazine or a newspaper and sell time or space to advertisers and their agencies. 2 You can join a retailer like Sears Roebuck, and work as a copywriter, art director or advertising manager. 3 You can join a manufacturing company like Procter & Gamble, and work as a brand manager. 4 You can join an advertising agency.
- Said Winston Churchill, ‘PERFECTIONISM is spelled PARALYSIS.’
- Hard work, says the Scottish proverb, never killed a man. People die of boredom and disease. There is nothing like an occasional all-night push to enliven morale – provided you are part of the push. Never leave the bridge in a storm.
- ‘To be under pressure is inescapable. Pressure takes place through all the world: war, siege, the worries of state. We all know men who grumble under these pressures, and complain. They are cowards. They lack splendor. But there is another sort of man who is under the same pressure, but does not complain. For it is the friction which polishes him. It is pressure which refines and makes him noble.’
- I know a big corporation which insists that its agencies negotiate terms of business with its Purchasing Department, as though they were selling office furniture. Would they do this with lawyers and accountants?
- Testimonials from celebrities get high recall scores, but I have stopped using them because readers remember the celebrity and forget the product. What’s more, they assume that the celebrity has been bought, which is usually the case. On the other hand, testimonials from experts can be persuasive – like having an ex-burglar testify that he had never been able to crack a Chubb safe.
