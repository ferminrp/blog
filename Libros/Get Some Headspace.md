### Highlights

- Traditionally, meditation students were taught first how to approach the technique, then how to practice it, before finally learning how to integrate the techniques into their everyday lives.
- Mindfulness means to be present, in the moment, undistracted. It implies resting the mind in its natural state of awareness, which is free of any bias or judgment.
- Meditation is simply a technique to provide you with the optimum conditions for practicing the skill of mindfulness.
- What is headspace? If mindfulness is the ability to be present, to rest in the moment whatever you’re doing, and meditation is the best way of learning that skill, then “headspace” could be considered the outcome. I’m using the word in the broadest possible context here. In fact, many people might choose to use the word “happiness” instead. The problem with the word “happiness” is it tends to get confused with the emotion of happiness. Don’t get me wrong, having fun, enjoying yourself, laughing and smiling are wonderful aspects of life. Who wouldn’t want to experience more of these things? But life’s not continually like that. Stuff happens. And that “stuff” is not always nice. As much as we try to ignore the fact, life can be difficult, stressful, upsetting and even painful at times. So the type of happiness that just comes and goes dependent on our circumstances and mood is too temporary, too unstable, to offer us any lasting sense of calm or clarity.
- meditation was just one part of three key aspects. The first part of the training would be understanding how to approach the technique. This means discovering the dynamics of the mind and how it’s likely to behave when you practice the technique. Only then would you be introduced to the actual meditation techniques. But there was a third aspect too. Having gained a sense of familiarity with the technique, the emphasis would be on the integration of that quality of mind into everyday life.
- For meditation to really work, to get the very best from the techniques, it’s vital that all three components are present: how best to approach the techniques, how best to practice the techniques, and how best to integrate the techniques.
- we just need to know how to relate to them. What you need to ask yourself,” he continued, “is how much of your thinking is helpful, productive, and how much is unhelpful or unproductive.
- It was a process of giving up control, of stepping back, learning how to focus the attention in a passive way, while simply resting the mind in its own natural awareness.
- “Happiness is just happiness,” he went on, “no big deal. It comes and it goes. Sadness is just Sadness, no big deal. It comes and it goes. If you can give up your desire to always experience pleasant things, at the same time as giving up your fear of experiencing unpleasant things, then you’ll have a quiet mind.”
- One of the most important was that the emotion itself is often not the problem. It’s the way we react to it that causes the problem.
- Emotions affect our perception of people, of situations and the environment in which we live. As a direct consequence, they also affect our Relationships with people, situations and the environment in which we live. Emotions are the filter between “us” and the “world.” When we feel angry the world can look very threatening: we see situations as obstacles and other people as enemies. And yet when we feel happy, the world can appear as quite a friendly place. We view the same situations as opportunities and the same people as friends. The world around us has not changed that much, but our experience of that world is radically different.
- Traits Traits are those emotions that seem to define a character. It might be “cheerful Amy” or “moody Mark.” These traits can reflect our upbringing, social conditioning, and the experiences that have shaped us along the way. It’s as if they are part of our genetic code and they tend to feel very “set” in nature. Because of this, many people are not even that aware of their own traits.
- States “States” however refer to those fleeting emotions that come and go in everyday life. Perhaps someone says something unpleasant to you, your child takes their first steps, or you get some bad news. These things are likely to be met with the appropriate emotion that will come and then go again, they are the “ups and downs” of life.
