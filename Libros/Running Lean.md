### Highlights

- Running Lean is a systematic process for iterating from Plan A to a plan that works, before running out of resources.
- And finally, even though customers hold all the answers, you simply cannot ask them what they want. If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses. — Henry Ford A lot of people cite the preceding quote and declare it hopeless to talk to customers. But hidden in this quote is a customer problem statement: had customers said “faster horses,” they would really have been asking for something faster than their existing alternative, which happened to be horses. Given the right context, customers can clearly articulate their problems, but it’s your job to come up with the solution. It is not the customer’s job to know what they want. — Steve Jobs
- Customer Development Customer Development is a term coined by Steve Blank and is used to describe the parallel process of building a continuous feedback loop with customers throughout the product development cycle. It is defined in his book, The Four Steps to the Epiphany. The key takeaway from Customer Development can best be summed up as: Get out of the building. — Steve Blank Most of the answers lie outside the building — not on your computer, or in the lab. You have to get out and directly engage customers.
- The key takeaway from Lean Startup can best be summed up around the concept of using smaller, faster iterations for testing a vision. Startups that succeed are those that manage to iterate enough times before running out of resources. — Eric Ries
- All men dream: but not equally. Those that dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible. — T.E. Lawrence, “Lawrence of Arabia”
- Everyone gets hit by ideas when they least expect them (in the shower, while driving, etc.). Most people ignore them. Entrepreneurs choose to act on them.
- While a strong vision is required to create a mantra and make meaning, a Lean Startup strives to uphold a strong vision with facts, not faith. It is important to accept that your initial vision is built largely on untested assumptions (or hypotheses). Running Lean helps you systematically test and refine that initial vision.
- Taking several weeks or months to write a 60-page business plan largely built on untested hypotheses is a form of waste. Waste is any human activity which absorbs resources but creates no value. — James P. Womak and Daniel T. Jones, Lean Thinking (Free Press) My format of choice is to use the one-page business model diagram (Lean Canvas) shown in Figure 1-1.
- Customers don’t care about your solution. They care about their problems. — Dave McClure, 500 Startups
- Investors, and more important, customers, identify with their problems and don’t care about your solution (yet). Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are naturally wired to look for solutions. But chasing after solutions to problems no one cares enough about is a form of waste.
- A startup goes through three distinct stages, as shown in Figure 1-3.
- The first stage is about determining whether you have a problem worth solving before investing months or years of effort into building a solution. While ideas are cheap, acting on them is quite expensive. A problem worth solving boils down to three questions: Is it something customers want? (must-have) Will they pay for it? If not, who will? (viable) Can it be solved? (feasible)
- Stage 3: Scale Key question: How do I accelerate growth? After product/market fit, some level of success is almost always guaranteed. Your focus at this stage shifts toward growth, or scaling your business model. Pivot Before Product/Market Fit, Optimize After
- Achieving product/market fit is the first significant milestone of a startup and greatly influences both strategy and tactics. For this reason, it is helpful to further delineate the stages of a startup as “before product/market fit” and “after product/market fit.” Before product/market fit, the focus of the startup centers on learning and pivots. After product/market fit, the focus shifts toward growth and optimizations.
- Pivot is a term used by Eric Ries to describe a change in direction of a startup while staying grounded in learning. The best way to differentiate pivots from optimizations is that pivots are about finding a plan that works, while optimizations are about accelerating that plan.
- In a pivot experiment, you attempt to validate parts of the business model hypotheses in order to find a plan that works. In an optimization experiment, you attempt to refine parts of the business model hypotheses in order to accelerate a working plan. The goal of the first is a course correction (or a pivot). The goal of the second is efficiency (or scale).
- Before product/market fit, a startup needs to be architected to maximize learning.
- the ideal time to raise your big round of funding is after product/market fit, because at that time, both you and your investors have aligned goals: to scale the business.
- Instead, your first goal should be to establish just enough of a runway to allow you to start testing and validating your business model with customers.
- While not the same thing, bootstrapping and Lean Startups are quite complementary. Both cover techniques for building low-burn startups by eliminating waste through the maximization of existing resources before expending effort on the acquisition of new or external resources. Bootstrapping + Lean Startup = Low-Burn Startup
- It begins in the Build stage with a set of ideas or hypotheses that are used to create some artifact (mock-ups, code, landing page, etc.) for the purpose of testing a hypothesis. We put this artifact in front of customers and “measure” their response using a combination of qualitative and quantitative data. This data is used to derive specific “learning” that serves to validate or refute a hypothesis, which in turn drives the next set of actions.
- While an experiment helps you validate or invalidate a specific business model hypothesis, an iteration strings multiple experiments together toward achieving a specific goal, such as getting to product/market fit.
- Distinguish between customers and users. If you have multiple user roles in your product, identify your customers. A customer is someone who pays for your product. A user does not.
- Split broad customer segments into smaller ones. I’ve worked with startups that felt the problems they are solving are so universal, they apply to everyone. You can’t effectively build, design, and position a product for everyone. While you might be aiming to build a mainstream product, you need to start with a specific customer in mind. Even Facebook, with its now 500 million+ users, started with a very specific user in mind: Harvard University students.
- Put everyone on the same canvas at first. If you are building a multisided business, you might find it necessary to outline different problems, channels, and value propositions for each side of the market. I recommend starting with a single canvas first and using a different color or tag to identify each customer segment. This helps you visualize everything on a single page. Then split if needed.
- Sketch a Lean Canvas for each customer segment. As you’ll find shortly, the elements of your business model can and will vary greatly by customer segment. I recommend starting with the top two or three customer segments you feel you understand the best or find most promising.
- Sketch a canvas in one sitting. While it’s tempting to iterate endlessly on the whiteboard, your initial canvas should be sketched quickly — in less than 15 minutes. The point of creating the canvas is to take a snapshot of what’s in your head at this moment in time, then move on to identifying what’s riskiest, and finally get out of the building and test your model with people other than yourself. It’s OK to leave sections blank. Rather than trying to research or debate the “right” answers, put something down or leave it blank. Leaving a section blank might be indicative of what’s really riskiest about your model and the place to start your testing. Some other elements, like Unfair Advantage, take time to figure out, and your best answer right now might be “I don’t know,” which is also OK. The canvas is meant to be an organic document that evolves with time. Be concise. It’s a lot easier to describe something in a paragraph than in a single sentence. The space constraints on the canvas are a great way to distill your business model down to its essence. Aim to fit your canvas on a single page. Think in the present. Business plans try too hard to predict the future, which is impossible. Instead, write your canvas with a “getting things done” attitude. Based on your current stage and what you know right now, what are the next sets of hypotheses you need to test to move your product forward? Use a customer-centric approach. Alex Osterwalder describes several techniques for approaching an initial business model canvas in his book. Since Running Lean is heavily customer-driven, I find it sufficient to start with just a customer-centric approach. As we’ll see shortly, tweaking just the customer segment can completely change the business model.
- For the customer segment you are working with, describe the top one to three problems they need solved. Another way to think about problems is in terms of the jobs customers need done: When people need to get a job done, they hire a product or service to do it for them. The marketer’s task is to understand what jobs periodically arise in customers’ lives for which they might hire products the company could make. — Clayton M. Christensen List existing alternatives.
- Document how you think your early adopters address these problems today. Unless you are solving a brand new problem (unlikely), most problems have existing solutions. Many times these solutions may not be from an obvious competitor. As an example, the biggest alternative to most online collaboration tools is not another collaboration tool, but email. Doing nothing could also be a viable alternative for a customer if the pain is not acute enough.
- Unique Value Proposition: Why you are different and worth buying getting attention. “Selling” is a conversation, and I believe it’s too hard to do that with a single statement. More important, the first battle isn’t even selling; it’s getting a prospect’s attention. Note First-time visitors spend eight seconds on average on a landing page. Your UVP is their first interaction with your product. Craft a good UVP and they might stay and view the rest of your site. Otherwise, they’ll simply leave.
- Here are some of my tips on how to craft a UVP: Be different, but make sure your difference matters. The key to unlocking what’s different about your product is deriving your UVP directly from the number-one problem you are solving. If that problem is indeed worth solving, you’re more than halfway there already. Target early adopters. Too many marketers try to target the “middle” in the hopes of reaching mainstream customers, and in the process they water down their message. Your product is not ready for mainstream customers yet. Your sole job should be to find and target early adopters, which requires bold, clear, and specific messaging. Focus on finished story benefits. You’ve probably heard about the importance of highlighting benefits over features. But benefits still require your customers to translate them to their worldview. A good UVP gets inside the head of your customers and focuses on the benefits your customers derive after using your product.
- So, for instance, if you are creating a résumé-building service: A feature might be “professionally designed templates.” The benefit would be an “eye-catching résumé that stands out.” But the finished story benefit would be “landing your dream job.”
- A good formula for crafting an effective UVP (by way of Dane Maxwell) is: Instant Clarity Headline = End Result Customer Wants + Specific Period of Time + Address the Objections Note The second and third items in the preceding formula are great if you can use them, but they are not required. A classic example that fits this formula is Domino’s slogan: Hot fresh pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or it’s free.
- Inbound channels use “pull messaging” to let customers find you organically, while outbound channels rely on “push messaging” to reach customers. Examples of inbound channels: Blogs SEO Ebooks White papers Webinars Examples of outbound channels: SEM Print/TV ads Trade shows Cold calling
- As a scalable channel, direct sales only make sense in businesses where the aggregate lifetime value of the customers exceeds the total compensation of your direct sales people, such as in certain B2B and enterprise products. But as a learning channel, direct selling is one of the most effective, since you interact face to face with the customer. First sell manually, then automate.
- Your MVP should address not only the top problems customers have identified as being important to them, but also the problems that are worth solving. By that definition, you should plan to deliver enough value to justify charging.
- Getting paid is the first form of validation. Getting a customer to give you money is one of the hardest actions you can ask them to take and is an early form of product validation.
- List the operational costs you will incur while taking your product to market. It’s hard to accurately calculate these too far into the future. Instead, focus on the present: What will it cost you to interview 30 to 50 customers? What will it cost you to build and launch your MVP? What will your ongoing burn rate look like in terms of both fixed and variable costs? Use the revenue streams and cost structure inputs to calculate a break-even point and estimate how much time, money, and effort you need to get there.
- Another frequently cited advantage in business models is the “first-mover” advantage. However, it doesn’t take much to see that being first can actually be a disadvantage, as most of the hard work of paving new ground (risk mitigation) falls on your shoulders, only to be potentially picked up later by fast-followers unless you’re able to constantly outpace them with a real “unfair advantage.” None of these companies were first movers: Ford, Toyota, Google, Microsoft, Apple, or Facebook. An interesting perspective (via Jason Cohen) to keep in mind is that anything worth copying will be copied, especially once you start to demonstrate a viable business model.
- Here are some examples of real unfair advantages that fit this definition: Insider information The right “expert” endorsements A dream team Personal authority Large network effects Community Existing customers SEO ranking
- We know that startups are highly uncertain, but uncertainty and risk aren’t the same thing. We can be uncertain about a lot of things that aren’t risky.
- Uncertainty: The lack of complete certainty, that is, the existence of more than one possibility. Risk: A state of uncertainty where some of the possibilities involve a loss, catastrophe, or other undesirable outcome.
- The way you quantify risk in your business model is by quantifying the probabilities of a specific outcome along with quantifying the associated loss if you’re wrong. This is a key step to prioritizing what’s riskiest on your business model and determining where to start.
- Here are some guidelines for running business model interviews: Avoid the 10-slide deck. I completely avoid a traditional “10-slide deck” because the point of the interview is learning versus pitching. The other extreme, no slides, although most natural, requires practice and may not lead to as many actionable insights because it may be hard for the other person to retain everything you tell her. My tool of choice is an incremental build of the Lean Canvas delivered on an iPad (or paper). I start with a blank canvas and incrementally reveal parts of the business model as I walk through it. Devote 20% of your time to setup, 80% to conversation.
- Ask specific questions. I specifically want to know: What do they consider to be the riskiest aspect of this plan? Have they overcome similar risks? How? How would they go about testing these risks? Are there other people I should speak with? Be wary of the “advisor paradox.” As we’ll see shortly, just as customer interviews aren’t about asking customers what they want, these interviews aren’t about asking advisors what to do. The Advisor Paradox: Hire advisors for good advice but don’t follow it, apply it. — Venture Hacks
- The Problem team The Problem team is mostly involved with “outside-the-building” activities such as interviewing customers, running usability tests, and so on. The Solution team The Solution team is mostly involved with “inside-the-building” activities such as writing code, running tests, deploying releases, and so on.
- The ideal Problem/Solution team size is two or three people. There are many arguments for building your Release 1.0 (minimum viable product, or MVP) with a small team: Communication is easier. You build less. You keep costs low.
- Development If you are building a product, you need strong product development skills on your team. Having prior experience building stuff is key, along with expertise in the specific technology you are using. Design By “design” I mean both aesthetics and usability. In newer markets, function can take precedence over form, but we live in an increasingly “design-aware” world where form cannot be ignored. Also, a product is not just a collection of features but rather a collection of user flows. You need people on your team that can deliver on the right experience that matches your customers’ worldview. Marketing Everything else is marketing. Marketing drives the external perception of your product, and you need people that can put themselves in the shoes of your customer. Good copywriting and communication skills are key here, along with an understanding of [[Metrics]], pricing, and positioning.
- Customer interviews are about exploring what you don’t know you don’t know.
- Product risk: What are you solving? (Problem) How do customers rank the top three problems? Market risk: Who is the competition? (Existing Alternatives) How do customers solve these problems today? Customer risk: Who has the pain? (Customer Segments) Is this a viable customer segment?
- Your first objective is measuring how customers react to your top problems. Some ways of doing this are measuring customer reaction to a problem-centric teaser landing page,[16] blog post, or a Google/Facebook ad. While these tactics can be helpful in quickly gauging problem resonance with customers, you still need to engage customers more actively to truly understand the problems they face — specifically if/how they solve them today.
- Look for identifying demographics among the responses that were most favorable (i.e., strong problem resonance). Similarly, drop segments that were least favorable.
- Your eventual goal is to distill your product down to one “must-have” problem — one Unique Value Proposition (UVP).
