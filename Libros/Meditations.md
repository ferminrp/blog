### Highlights

- “You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find [[strength]].”
- Life’s ups and downs can only harm us by way of our thoughts, emotions, and reactions—pain is never caused by the thing itself but instead the way we think about it. It’s our own thoughts that create suffering, and our own thoughts that offer a way out of suffering.
- “There is nowhere that a man can find a more peaceful and trouble-free retreat than in his own mind,” he writes. “So constantly give yourself this retreat, and renew yourself.”
- every trial and tribulation in life presents an opportunity for learning, growth, and the cultivation of virtue.
- the “art of life” is to view all of life as an “old and faithful friend,” which only brings exactly what is needed for our own growth.
- to regard nothing else, even in the smallest degree, but reason always; and always to remain unaltered in the agonies of pain,
- Think of your long procrastination, and of the many opportunities given you by the Gods, but left unused.
- a limit is set to your days, which, if you use them not for your enlightenment, will depart, as you yourself will, and return no more.
- Do every deed, speak every word, think every thought in the knowledge that you may end your days any moment.
