### Highlights

- True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not.
- American philosopher William James says, “The greatest discovery of any generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitude.” The Happiness Advantage author Shawn Achor says, “It’s not necessarily the reality that shapes us but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality.”
- “You always think the geniuses are at the next level.”
- Sales success is about sales. Your book is a commercial hit! Everybody’s reading it, everybody’s talking about it, you’re on TV. You sell hundreds then thousands then millions of copies. Your book becomes an “it book.” A catchphrase. Dump trucks beep while backing into your garage to pour endless royalty payments. Social success means you’re a success among your peers. People you respect. This is critical success. The industry loves you! The New York Times reviews your book. You’re short-listed for the Man Booker Prize. An influential author you look up to sends you a letter, which feels like gold. Self success is in your head. It’s invisible! Only you know if you have it. Self success means you achieved what you wanted to achieve. For yourself. You’re genuinely proud of your accomplishment, you’re happy with your work, and, most important, you’re satisfied. You want nothing. You feel contentment. Some people believe without self success, no amount of sales or social success will ever feel meaningful.
- Buddha says, “You can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your Love and affection than you are yourself and that person is not to be found anywhere. You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your Love and affection.”
- The three steps are: Hide Apologize Accept
- If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two impostors just the same.
- None of us can control our emotions. We can only control our reactions to our emotions.
- There is nothing more satisfying than being loved for who you are and nothing more painful than being loved for who you’re not but pretending to be.
- It’s hard meeting people willing to share their authentic selves when you first meet them. Chris Rock said, “When you meet somebody for the first time, you’re not meeting them. You’re meeting their representative!”
