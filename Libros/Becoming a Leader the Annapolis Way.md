### Highlights

- He [a leader] should be the soul of tact, patience, justice, firmness, and charity. No meritorious act of a subordinate should escape his attention or be left to pass without its reward, even if the reward is only a word of approval. Conversely, he should not be blind to a single fault in any subordinate, though, at the same time, he should be quick and unfailing to distinguish error from malice, thoughtlessness from incompetency, and well-meant shortcoming from heedless or stupid blunder.
- “that quality which can make other men [and women] do what they do not want to do and like it.”
- Manage time effectively. Make commitments to tasks and organizations and be faithful. Recognize that following well is a prerequisite to outstanding [[Leadership]]. Actively seek out opportunities for [[Leadership]]. Observe and critically evaluate one’s own [[Leadership]] performance. Reflect on outcomes and explore alternatives for use in future situations. Understand that character matters; [[Leadership]] requires virtue. Correctly diagnose [[Leadership]] situations and select the most appropriate leader style for the situation. Constantly and tenaciously work at increasing both technical and interpersonal expertise and competence. Become inoculated to stress and capable of maintaining emotional equanimity during difficult situations; maintain focus without disturbance. Develop interpersonal skills and communication savvy; heighten emotional intelligence. Empower and praise always. Be an intentional model; lead by example. Take care of your people first.
- At USNA, we foster intrinsic motivation. Yes, we meet our students’ basic needs and even cover all expenses associated with their education, but we generally offer nothing more than praise and recognition for the kind of commitment and loyalty these officers-in-training exhibit. Midshipmen harbor a sense of meaning and purpose about their work that most businesses seldom seem to conjure up from employees.
- Research confirms that a goal is much more highly esteemed if it is difficult to achieve.
- More than classmates, these fellow midshipmen are thoroughly committed to protecting and assisting one another to succeed. Midshipmen quickly learn that success only comes when units work together.
- Yes, they will all become military officers, but how will they serve? What contribution will they make and how will they employ their unique talents and interests both to enhance the Navy or Marine Corps and to become the people they were intended to be? They are free to become self-actualized. And when a person can become self-actualized, he or she is considerably more likely to be a loyal and committed organizational member. Too few organizations work at explicitly addressing needs of belonging and esteem and, subsequently, too few employees are encouraged to explore their own unique gifts and aspirations.
- Leaders can fail grandly when followers resist directives, fail to share the leader’s vision, or refuse to do the work required for mission accomplishment.
- A study of the distinguishing characteristics of junior officers on board the Navy’s top-performing ships revealed some interesting trends in the behavior and personality of these excellent followers. In comparison to junior officers aboard average or low-performing ships, junior officers on the most successful ships were significantly more likely to: Work as a cohesive unit. Excellent followers work as a team. They have more interaction and more positive expectations of one another. Support top [[Leadership]]. These officers were loyal to the captain. They were enthusiastic supporters of their captain’s policies and directives and they never allowed enlisted personnel to sense division among officers or lack of advocacy for the captain’s orders. In other words, these excellent followers were congruent. Raise concerns with leaders. Outstanding followers in the fleet did not hesitate to raise questions and concerns with their commanding officers. They brought bad news to the CO and pointed out shortcomings of the captain’s plan-of-the-day or plans for battle before problems could result in failure. But they never voiced criticism in front of the crew. Take initiative. Junior officers on board top-flight ships are self-starters and hard-chargers. Always searching for ways to enhance the ship’s readiness for action, they took action when a need or problem was discovered. They didn’t wait to be told. Take responsibility for team performance. Excellent followers own a pervasive sense of responsibility for the ultimate success or failure of the ship’s mission. Unlike the more passive or disengaged junior officers on ships that repeatedly fail to compete for performance prizes, these officers felt personally responsible for their unit’s ultimate success.
- to pass an order off as someone else’s is lousy followership. And this makes for lousy [[Leadership]].
- Yes, they are respectful of authority and take orders effectively, but they do not require constant direction and reassurance. In many instances, the self-managing follower makes decisions without first seeking approval or direction from the boss. And this is not because he or she has trouble with authority or difficulty in following. These followers are willing to take initiative when it counts; they make good decisions and then brief their bosses when they can. In a pinch they ask themselves what the commanding officer would do, make a move, and live with the consequences. Over time, a track record of initiative and good judgment combine to build the CO’s trust. These followers enjoy increasing latitude and freedom in the follower role.
- STICKY/DEPENDENT Few things are as unpleasant for leaders as a high-maintenance follower. This is the subordinate who requires copious quantities of reassurance in order to get the job done. So lacking in self-esteem is this follower that he or she feels painfully inadequate. The dependent follower waits passively for [[Leadership]]. His or her locus of control is external; this follower will not take initiative or show autonomy. The dependent is usually happy to follow orders, but feels so insecure that the leader must give detailed instructions for each task and then reassure the follower that his or her work is acceptable. Dependent followers are to [[Leadership]] as black holes are to the universe. They drain the leader’s time and energy and usually don’t perform at a level that justifies this expenditure of resources. In the Navy, dependent followers are always a liability. Like the anxious/immobilized follower, they can place others at risk and distract leaders from their primary objective. They never make good leaders themselves and are usually ineffective in any context requiring innovation or tenacity. Dependent personalities rarely gain admission to USNA. When they do, they are among the first to drop out.

- LEADING WITH VISION Whether leading a football team, a major corporation, or the crew of a Navy destroyer, leaders have got both to create and successfully communicate a vision. Excellent [[Leadership]] hinges on the leader’s capacity to construct the right vision for a unit or organization at just the right time. By vision we mean an ideal image or picture of what the unit can become. Successful visions are clear, compelling, and carefully articulated. Such a vision is a primary key to creating real organizational change. The outstanding leader is a fine storyteller in the sense of creating an ideal, yet realistic story of what the group or organization could ultimately become and achieve. The vision should have meaning to the group members; in a real way it must captivate their interest and their faith.
- He ultimately assumed command of a nuclear aircraft carrier with a crew of 6000 sailors. By that time he had a clear vision of what it took to lead and win. After assuming command, he first met with the XO and department heads, then with the entire chief’s mess, and finally with the entire crew on the flight deck and explained his vision. It was simple. He told them that each crewmember should consciously select one thing he or she had to do each day and be commited to doing it a little bit better than it had ever been done before. The CO made this the ship’s motto, “Get a Little Better Each Day.” He reinforced it constantly with chats on the ship’s intercom system and visits to workshops. His philosophy was that if you get thousands of little improvements each day, you will end up with dramatic improvements around the entire ship. His ideas paid off—his carrier won not only the Battle E, but also the aviation safety award for that year.
- ”VISIONING” LEADERS NEED NOT BE “VISIONARY” Please notice that we are not talking about “visionary” leaders here. A leader who can predict future trends and anticipate cultural or economic shifts may indeed be a credit to any organization, but such visionary abilities mean little if the leader cannot craft a convincing picture of what the immediate group can become. In the Navy, we need leaders who can take the helm of everyday military teams and mold them into high-performing combat crews. This seldom demands futuristic vision (although the Department of Defense employs a host of wonderfully visionary engineers, scientists, and strategists), but rather, the capacity to create vision at the level of the local unit.
- For midshipmen and officers to thrive in the visioning role, they must construct and fully embrace three important domains of vision: (1) self-vision, (2) follower vision, and (3) unit or command vision. In the balance of this chapter, we suggest that a capable leader must create and endorse vision effectively in each of these areas.
- Although developing a clear and accurate picture of self as leader can be painful, it sets the stage for self-understanding and growth. Armed with a realistic view of self, the midshipman can now begin acquiring and sharpening those skill areas that need extra attention. And this is essential for the next level of visioning—developing a vision of one’s followers. Only a secure, confident, and self-aware leader will really take the time to know and affirm followers.
- So how does a leader create and transmit a vision for the follower? Here are some guidelines: Learn about your followers; spend adequate time interacting with them. Study their primary talents, their aspirations, and their current weaknesses. Articulate a positive and ambitious view of the follower; communicate a vision that motivates, but avoid unfair or unattainable expectations. Find ways to consistently communicate this vision to your follower.
- When he asked me how I stood in my Naval Academy class, I swelled with pride as I answered, “Sir, I stood 59th in my class of 820.” I sat back to wait for his congratulations, which never came. Instead he asked me, “Did you always do your best?” To which I had to say honestly, “No, Sir, I didn’t always do my best.” He asked me one final question that I have never been able to forget or answer. He said, “Why not?” I later entitled my first book Why Not the Best?
- Although there is no formula for creating a vision for your team, there are a few important components. First, try to involve the main stakeholders in formulating the vision. A submarine skipper who decides his sub will be the most squared-away and ever-ready sub in the fleet will have little success without buy-in from his officers and chiefs. In fact, if this vision is seen as serving the CO but not the crew, it may be sabotaged at every turn. Second, make sure the vision plays to the strengths of both the individual followers and the leader. Third, the vision has got to inspire and create a sense of urgent meaning and personal importance among the crew. In our departmental home at USNA, the [[Leadership]], Ethics, and Law Department, we hold a clear vision of ourselves as creating officers for the Navy and Marine Corps; officers who can not only withstand the demands of leading in combat, but who can thrive in this arduous and potentially life-threatening environment. Fourth, an ideal vision is concrete enough to lead to attainable and tangible results. The vision’s outcomes must be observable. It is one thing to say, “We’re the best damn ship in the Navy.” It’s another thing to show proof that this vision has been realized. Finally, remember that the CO had damn well better put the vision into practice himself or herself in both personal and public behavior. No command vision will succeed without the authentic commitment of the leader. The CO had better be a true believer and willing to go all the way with the crew.
- STRESS AND THE ART OF ACCURATE APPRAISAL All leaders face stressful circumstances. Excellent leaders understand that appraising a situation as manageable is half the battle. At USNA, midshipmen receive explicit training in event appraisal. Stress researchers Lazarus and Folkman have identified two distinct phases in this process. At the primary appraisal phase, leaders must decide whether an event is a direct threat (liable to harm or damage) or merely a challenge (although difficult or unpleasant, the event may yield some gain). When we determine that a stressful event constitutes a threat, our sympathetic nervous system kicks into gear—mobilizing us to fight or run like crazy. Physiological signs of this threat response include muscle tension, heightened blood pressure, hyperalertness, and inhibited sleep. Of course, maintaining this state for an extended period is exhausting and eventually dangerous (e.g., long-term fatigue and lowered immune system functioning). Combat leaders must accurately interpret real threats and respond accordingly. Failure to do so will result in death for the leader and the entire unit. But most stressful situations do not qualify as dire threats. Most are challenges. Appraising a situation as a challenge will typically produce useful stimulation and mobilization without overwhelming anxiety and dysfunctional adrenaline. Midshipmen learn that, in fact, there are very few real threats in life. They learn to perceive most events accurately as challenges. And doing so prepares them for adaptive and creative responses.
- Ship, shipmate, self. This is one of the most important phrases new midshipmen learn as soon as they put on the uniform at the Naval Academy. It sets the tone, not only for their years at the Academy, but also for their entire career, and many would say for the rest of their lives. For sailors in the Navy, it is not about self. First, foremost, and always, it is about the ship, squadron, submarine, or Marine unit. Protecting the ship and completing the mission must always be foremost in every sailor’s or marine’s mind. Nothing is more important; no duty is more sacred.
- There is an unconditional quality to the shipmate concept. If you are my shipmate, I stick up for you through thick and thin, not because of your performance, but because of your station. Wearing the uniform entitles you to this service from me. There is personal honor at stake here. If we are shipmates, you and I have an implicit agreement for mutual care and protection. I expect you to watch out for my interests and I will always do the same for you.
- NEVER BILGE A SHIPMATE Not only is an academy midshipmen bound to keep track of his or her shipmates, there is also a clear prohibition against doing anything to take advantage of, get one over on, or bring a shipmate to the attention of superiors in a negative way. Such behavior would be considered “bilging a shipmate,” and it is ardently avoided. One can also bilge a shipmate by neglecting to provide important information or by failing to help a shipmate correct an obvious problem (shirt untucked, shoes poorly shined, or a presentation incorrectly prepared) before it comes to the attention of an officer or upperclassman.
- There is only one exception to this time-honored requirement to protect one’s shipmates: violations of the honor code. We have already described the midshipman honor system. Although no midshipman is eager to report a peer for a problem of honor, midshipmen are nonetheless the most stringent members of the USNA community when it comes to accountability to this code. In a profound way, this is also a crucial part of being a shipmate; you can count on me to hold you accountable, just as you can expect absolute integrity from me.
- When a leader views his or her followers as precious resources to be served and protected, followers pick up on this attitude quickly. And nothing will inspire deep and unrelenting loyalty as quickly as a leader whose quest is to take care of his or her people in the context of achieving a mission. Sadly, too many leaders in other environments overlook the simple truth that responding to followers as “mates” versus subordinates can make all the difference. Sometimes, it’s the simple things that leave a lasting impression.
- I served as first battalion commander for the fall semester of my first class year. On the day the brigade returned for the academic year, I was responsible for reporting the muster reports for the battalion. A couple of companies were late reporting to me. When the officer of the watch asked me to account for First Battalion, I explained the situation and indicated I was having difficulty obtaining information from two of my companies. The officer of the watch then proceeded in no uncertain terms to remind me of the five basic responses, one of which was “No excuse, Sir!” His rebuke stung, but he made a good point. I should stick up for my subordinates, taking the heat and shielding them, even if it’s not my fault. To do otherwise squanders an opportunity given to me to show my subordinates that I care for them enough to put myself in “harm’s way” for my troops.
- SOMEDAY, THE DRILLING WILL MAKE SENSE Beyond drilling for parades, midshipmen’s lives are nearly dominated by routine, repetition, and memorization—especially during the plebe year. Chopping, marching, drilling for parades, memorizing reams of apparently worthless information are all part of a larger design: make these future officers into men and women with the ability to memorize information, attend to details, follow orders instantaneously, adhere to custom and protocol, and understand the virtue of over-learning vital mission-related information and skills. By over-learning we mean going over material or practicing protocols so many times that the material or activity can be repeated or carried out instantly and automatically—without taking time to reconsider the material or seek guidance regarding how to respond.
- Human beings are excellent observational learners; we learn how to be adults, spouses, and even leaders by watching important models.
- This is in stark contrast to the actions of President Bush. While on a weekend retreat to Camp David, he was informed of the tragedy. Even though he could do nothing tangible by returning to the White House, he did anyway. And in so doing, he helped stabilize the entire nation. Perception is everything. He was working in the White House, he appeared on television, and he was clearly leading the country. When times get tough it is important to consider symbols. President Bush offered a symbolic model of caring, commitment, control, and strength.
- Think of the intentional leader as a willful and deliberate teacher. He or she actively seeks opportunities to model crucial skills and leader behaviors as a means of guiding, developing, and mentoring. And it is essential that modeling be done in the right spirit. Rather than an opportunity to pompously prove one’s superiority, good modeling emanates from a sincere interest in helping followers absorb the skills, techniques, and procedures essential to their success as well as that of the organization. Rather than modeling arrogance, the ideal model is caring, transparent, and willing to admit foibles and failings. The excellent model is also modest and imbued with a good sense of humor and humility.
- “The basic role of the leader is to foster mutual respect and build a complementary team where each strength is made productive and each weakness made irrelevant.”
- At USNA, we work to help our midshipmen appreciate the fact that real influence as a leader comes from modeling positive support, genuine consideration, and behavior that is congruent with one’s policies and standards. This is what we call transformational [[Leadership]], and research suggests that transformational leaders
- create enduring loyalty and growth in subordinates because they identify with the leader. Because the leader is seen as genuine and supportive, followers truly “own” allegiance to the leader’s directives. Coercion is not required.
- Finally, leaders who are conscious of the examples they offer refuse to model or reward cynicism. Cynicism in organizations is a prominent concern these days. It emerges in an organization when there is a mismatch between expectations and experience. People often enter an organization, the Navy included, with an implicit psychological contract or a set of expectations about what the organization will be like and how they might benefit from their commitment to it. When expectations go unmet and followers perceive the contract to be violated, negative attitudes and behaviors ensue. One recent superintendent at USNA aptly described cynicism as “idealism with a broken heart.” Cynicism in a military command can result in lowered productivity, high turnover, reduced attention to the development of junior personnel, and most important, hampered ability to complete the mission. Excellent role models in the leader role have got to do three things to stamp out cynicism quickly: Leaders must identify cynical attitudes among followers. Leaders must make sure followers have appropriate expectations upon entering the organization and then follow through to insure that promises are kept and reasonable expectations are met. Leaders must not only refuse to become cynical themselves (especially when their own expectations about leaders go unmet), but they must also kindly confront it in subordinates and convey sincere expectations for enhanced performance.
- So what exactly is emotional intelligence? The term was originally coined by researchers Salovey and Mayer who defined it as “a form of social intelligence that involves the ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them, and to use information to guide one’s thinking and action.” Emotional intelligence (EI) has to do with a leader’s ability to work with others and effectively lead change. EI requires the ability to establish trust, to communicate warmth and positive regard for others, and the capacity to delay gratification and avoid impulsivity in any form.
- Socially skilled leaders have many friendships and connections. They are natural networkers and bridge-builders, and people often respond positively to their outgoing style and friendly, engaged demeanor. Now, military leaders do not have to be socialites or dyed in the wool extraverts to be emotionally sophisticated. They do need to have real Relationships, to be skilled at discovering and then building upon common ground between constituencies, and they need to be effective at persuasion.
- Empowering leaders share a number of behavioral habits in common. Empowering leaders offer unconditional and consistent praise and support. They see their followers as valuable, not because of their work, but because of who they are. They will follow through with punishment when it is deserved, but they never relish it and often work to find an outcome that teaches the lesson without slaying follower esteem and motivation.
- Although empowering leaders habitually relinquish control of the ship to the crew (delegate and then disappear), protection is a responsibility that must always remain with the leader. And make no mistake, efforts at empowerment will have zero effect if followers believe the leader will hang them out to dry for innovations gone awry or occasional failures.
- Obsessive-Compulsive. Equally incapable of empowerment, but for different reasons, the obsessive-compulsive (or as Freud would say, “anal retentive”) leader is notoriously rigid, ordered, driven by ritual, and anxious about failure. Although not suspicious of subordinates, this leader is too anxious to let others do important work and feels compelled to check and double check followers’ work. Personal rigidity translates into tight control and the effective destruction of spontaneous and autonomous thinking within the crew.
