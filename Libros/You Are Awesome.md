### Highlights

- We take tiny strings of trouble and extrapolate them into huge problems with our entire identities always on the line. And the younger we are, the more we do this since we have less experience to help us understand that things usually work out okay in the end. Once you get through one tough breakup, you’re a little better on the next one. Once you get through three, you’re a lot better. Once you suck at one job, you’re a little stronger the next time. But that first failure really is terrible.
- How do we shift the spotlight? We have to be aware and remember that we are quick to internalize. To self-flagellate. To point the dagger straight at our stomachs. To let the spotlight shine brightly into our own set of eyes. But a big part of resilience, of remembering we really are awesome, is performing this crucial mental separation. “Oh, wait. I’m thinking this failure is all about me. I’m pointing the spotlight at myself. I’m taking all the blame here.” Stop. Separate. Remember: It’s actually egotistical to think it’s all about you. Position it that way in your mind. Why? Because it’s true. Consider how many other factors are involved! Consider how many factors are far beyond your control.
- We all think that the way things are now is the way things will continue to be. If you’re flying high, that’s maybe not a bad thing, but if you’re falling, if you’re broken, if you’re busted, if you’re heartbroken, if you’re lonely, then this is a dangerous psychological tendency. And we all share it. When we’re at rock bottom, we are certain that there’s no way up. We think we’ll never get out of our parents’ basement. We think our divorce means we’ll never meet someone new. We think if we’ve lost our jobs we’ll be scrolling online temp postings forever. The researchers called this the “end of history illusion.”
- Because we confuse the challenge of picturing change with the improbability of change itself. We do. We confuse the challenge of picturing change (“What am I going to do now?”) with the improbability of change (“I’ll never find anything!”). In other words, you can’t picture yourself changing so you assume you won’t.
- The researcher and author Brené Brown calls shame “the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging—something we’ve experienced, done, or failed to do makes us unworthy of connection.”
- Those are the three questions: Will this matter on my deathbed? Can I do something about it? Is this a story I’m telling myself? It doesn’t mean it’s easy. It just means that on our road to resilience, on our journey to awesome, on our path to getting stronger, we recognize there’s an opportunity to be kinder to ourselves and we’re able to use a few small tools to help us get there. Because the truth is that most of what we think is a story we’re telling ourselves. Only you can decide what story you tell yourself. So tell yourself a better one.
- Accept the far-flung invite, hit a reading by an author you’ve never heard of, grab a ticket to a concert in a genre you never listen to, grab a cocktail at the hotel bar after your flight, attend the online meetup for an old passion you forgot you had and, of course, go to parties. Will it be awkward? Uncomfortable? Sometimes. Sometimes, sure. You might not meet anyone. You could have three superficial chats and connect with precisely nobody. You may leave feeling like you just wasted your time. That’s the risk. That’s the downside. That’s the potential for failure. But what’s the potential gain? The potential gain is that you’ll meet interesting people in interesting places. The potential gain is that you’ll drift into other lanes, you’ll go down new thinking paths, and you’ll slowly unfurl yourself from whatever mental sleeping bags you’re rolled up in. And maybe your experience will provoke and prompt new ideas, new efforts, new risks, and new ventures that you’ll fail at and learn from. Lose more to win more.
- There are far more problems and opportunities in the world than there are talented and hard-working people to solve them. The world needs talent and hard work to solve its problems so people with talent who are hard workers will have endless opportunities.”
- Don’t start swimming in the biggest pond you can find. Start in the smallest. Don’t chase the hot guy or hot girl at the beach. Find the nerd at the library. Find the broken company. Find the place nobody wants to be. And start there.
