### Highlights

- “How would you feel if you could no longer use Dropbox?” Users could respond “Very disappointed,” “Somewhat disappointed,” “Not disappointed,” or “N/A no longer using the product” (I wrote the question this way because I found that asking people if they were satisfied with a product didn’t deliver meaningful insights; disappointment was a much better gauge of product loyalty than satisfaction). Having already run this survey at numerous start-ups, I had found that companies where more than 40 percent of respondents said they would be “very disappointed” if they could no longer use the product had very strong growth potential, where those that fell under that 40 percent threshold tended to face a much harder path in growing the business (due to user apathy).
- Growth was about engineering systems of scale and enabling our users to grow the product for us.”
- By breaking down the traditional business silos and assembling cross-functional, collaborative teams that bring together staff with expertise in analytics, engineering, product management, and marketing, growth hacking allows companies to efficiently marry powerful data analysis and technical know-how with marketing savvy, to quickly devise more promising ways to fuel growth.

- “If you’re pushing code once every two weeks and your competitor is pushing code every week, just after two months that competitor will have done 10 times as many tests as you. That competitor will have learned 10 times, an order of magnitude more about their product than you.”
    - **Note:** Great Quote from Hacking Growth.
- This means that as more ad dollars continue to shift online, each ad has more competition for the same eyeballs, and that’s been driving prices up at an alarming rate.
- “73 percent of CEOs think marketers lack business credibility and are not effectiveness-focused enough,” and 72 percent of CEOs agreed with the statement that marketers “are always asking for money but can rarely explain how much incremental business this money will generate.”

- most growth is due to an accumulation of small wins. Like compounding interest in a savings account, these gains stack on top of one another to create liftoff.
- Growth teams should bring together staff who have a deep understanding of the strategy and business goals, those with the expertise to conduct data analysis, and those with the engineering chops to implement changes in the design, functionality, or marketing of the product and program experiments to test those changes.
- THE GROWTH LEAD In every case, a growth team needs a leader, who is like a battalion commander, with her boots on the ground, both managing the team and participating actively in the idea generation and experimentation process. The growth lead sets the course for experimentation as well as the tempo of experiments to be run, and monitors whether or not the team is meeting their goals. Growth teams should generally convene once a week, and the growth lead should run those meetings (which we’ll offer guidance on how to do shortly). Regardless of specialty or background, he or she plays a role that is part manager, part product owner, and part scientist. A key responsibility for the growth lead is choosing the core focus area and objectives for the team to work on and for what period of time.
- A growth lead might establish a monthly, quarterly, or even annual focus area, such as to get more users to upgrade from a free version of a product to a premium version, or to determine which would be the best new marketing channel for a product.
- All growth leads require a basic set of skills: fluency in data analysis; expertise or fluency in product management (meaning the process of developing and launching a product); and an understanding of how to design and run experiments.
- In general product managers oversee how the product and its various features are brought to life. As venture capitalist Ben Horowitz put it simply, “A good product manager is the CEO of the product.”4
- The people who write the code for the product features, mobile screens, and webpages that teams experiment with
- The process is a continuous cycle comprising four key steps: (1) data analysis and insight gathering; (2) idea generation; (3) experiment prioritization; and (4) running the experiments, and then circles back to the analyze step to review results and decide the next steps.
    - **Note:** Hacking Growth: The How ->
- All fast-growth companies share one thing in common. Regardless of who their customers are, their business model, and the type of product, industry, or region of the globe they’re operating in, they all make a product that a large group of people love. They’ve built products that, in the eyes of their customers, are simply must-have.
- One of the cardinal rules of growth hacking is that you must not move into the high-tempo growth experimentation push until you know your product is must-have, why it’s must-have, and to whom it is a must-have: in other words, what is its core value, to which customers, and why.
- THE MUST-HAVE SURVEY The first step is a simple survey Sean designed, one that he has found again and again throughout his career in Silicon Valley to be a remarkably reliable means of measuring whether customers love a product or not. This Must-Have Survey begins with the question: How disappointed would you be if this product no longer existed tomorrow? a) Very disappointed b) Somewhat disappointed c) Not disappointed (it really isn’t that useful) d) N/A—I no longer use it Interpreting the results is simple enough; if 40 percent or more of responses are “very disappointed,” then the product has achieved sufficient must-have status, which means the green light to move full speed ahead gunning for growth.
- the stages of the process are: data analysis and insight gathering, idea generation, experiment prioritization, running the experiments, and then returning to the analyze step to review results and decide next steps, in a continuous loop.
- spending on online ads in the US has doubled since 2010,1 and what’s more, in the US, Canada, and Western Europe at least, the growth of the Web audience is slowing, which essentially means companies are spending (and will continue to spend) more money to chase fewer potential customers.
- The first phase of work in scaling up your acquisition of customers should be devoted to achieving two additional types of fit: language/market fit, which is how well the way you describe the benefits of your product resonates with your target audience, and channel/product fit, which describes how effective the marketing channels are that you’ve selected to reach your intended audience with your product, such as paid search advertising or viral, or content, marketing.
- the first text they see must send the right message fast; and in fact, it must do so a good deal faster today than just a few years ago. Research has shown that the average attention span (the amount of time we focus on a new piece of information online) of humans is now eight seconds, which is down from twelve seconds in 2000, and confers on us the dubious distinction of having an attention span shorter than that of goldfish.5 With so little time to impress people, it is imperative that they understand almost immediately how your product can benefit them.
- the language you use must directly and persuasively connect with a need or desire they have in order to hook them—in eight seconds or less!—
